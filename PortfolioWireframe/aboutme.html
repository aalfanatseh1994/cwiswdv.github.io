  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <main>
      <p>From a young age, I have been a person with big academic dreams and professional goals which greatly drove my motivations and work ethics.
      In 2010, and as a young kid who just finished elementary school in Maan, Jordan.
      I heard about <span>United World Colleges-USA</span> program that would give young kids with outstanding academic achievements an opportunity.
      The opportunity to travel to the US to finish their school educations and possibly their undergraduate studies. 
      My academic achievements at the time qualified me for such a program and I was so excited to get into it. 
      However, as a young  kid who has never been away from his home city by himself, it was really difficult to take that decision, but my desire and dreams along with family support drove me to take this dare step.
